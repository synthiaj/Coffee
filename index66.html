            <strong>Meaning:</strong>

            <strong>Mix:</strong>

            <strong>Facts:</strong>
            <span id="box3">The term caffè latte was first used in English in 1867 by William Dean Howells in his essay "Italian Journeys".
</span>
            <span id="box4">A caffè latte differs from a latte macchiato. In a latte macchiato, espresso is added to milk, rather than the reverse, and caffè lattes have a stronger coffee flavour.
</span>
<span id="box5">Ideally it is served with latte art on top.
